/*The provided configuration snippet is a part of an ESLint configuration file (typically named .eslintrc.json) 
and is used to configure ESLint for linting TypeScript code. Let's break down each option:

"root": true: This option indicates that ESLint should stop looking for configuration files in parent directories once it finds this configuration file. 
It ensures that this configuration file is considered the root configuration for ESLint.

"parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser": This option specifies the parser to be used for TypeScript code. 
The @typescript-eslint/parser package is a parser that allows ESLint to understand TypeScript syntax.

"plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"]: This option specifies the ESLint plugins to be used. 
In this case, the @typescript-eslint plugin is included. 
This plugin provides additional rules and features specifically for TypeScript.

"extends": [...]: This option allows extending the ESLint configuration by including additional rule sets. I
n the provided example, the configuration extends the following rule sets:

"eslint:recommended": This rule set includes a set of recommended rules from ESLint itself.
"plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended": This rule set includes additional recommended rules specifically for TypeScript linting from the @typescript-eslint plugin.
"plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended": This rule set includes a set of rules considered best practices for TypeScript linting from the @typescript-eslint plugin.
"// "plugin:@shopify/esnext": This line is commented out and does not affect the configuration. It appears to be a reference to a plugin specific to the Shopify platform but is currently disabled.
"rules": { "no-console": "error" }: This option allows configuring specific ESLint rules and their severity levels. In this case, the rule "no-console" is set to "error", which means that ESLint will raise an error if the code contains any console statements.
